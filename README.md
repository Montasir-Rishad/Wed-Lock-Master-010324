**Features:**
Wed-Lock Master is basically a Matrimonial Software project which comes with various features including the following:

      1. User-friendly platform for finding partners.
      2. Secure personalized accounts.
      3. Easy filtering for bride/groom search.
      4. Community engagement via blogs.
      5. Direct chatting for communication.
      6. Rental car advertising option.
      7. Admin Panel for smooth operation.
      8. Ensures seamless, secure experience.

**Bakground Study:**Before developing a matrimonial website, we studied existing websites in Bangladesh, including-

      1. Bangladeshi Matrimony,
      2. BD Marriage,
      3. Noble Marriage, and
      4. Badhon Matrimony.

We found that the UI/UX of these websites was uncomfortably poor, & the design was outdated. Then we decided to create an optimum website that would provide better facilities for free, offering a new way to find partners. We also planned to implement robust power in the admin panel to enhance the existing matrimonial system.
